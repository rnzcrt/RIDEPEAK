                    RidePeak was born in the heart of Colorado in 2010, inspired by the breathtaking Rocky Mountains and the thriving outdoor community. Our founders, a group of cycling enthusiasts, sought to create bikes that could handle the diverse terrain they loved to explore—from steep mountain passes to smooth city roads. With backgrounds in engineering and design, they combined their expertise to craft bikes that were not only built for performance but also for the love of the ride.

                <p>
                    Starting out in a small garage, we've grown into a global brand, but our passion for adventure and craftsmanship remains unchanged. Every RidePeak bike is still meticulously designed to give you the ultimate riding experience, no matter where your journey takes you.
